            MARINA. Man is forgetful, but God remembers.<br>
            <br>
            ASTROFF. Thank you for that. You have spoken the truth.<br>

            Enter VOITSKI from the house. He has been asleep after dinner and
            looks rather dishevelled. He sits down on the bench and straightens his
            collar.<br>

            VOITSKI. H'm. Yes. [A pause] Yes.<br>

            ASTROFF. Have you been asleep?<br>

            VOITSKI. Yes, very much so. [He yawns] Ever since the Professor and his
            wife have come, our daily life seems to have jumped the track. I sleep
            at the wrong time, drink wine, and eat all sorts of messes for luncheon
            and dinner. It isn't wholesome. Sonia and I used to work together and
            never had an idle moment, but now Sonia works alone and I only eat and
            drink and sleep. Something is wrong.<br>

            MARINA. [Shaking her head] Such a confusion in the house! The Professor
            gets up at twelve, the samovar is kept boiling all the morning, and
            everything has to wait for him. Before they came we used to have dinner
            at one o'clock, like everybody else, but now we have it at seven. The
            Professor sits up all night writing and reading, and suddenly, at two
            o'clock, there goes the bell! Heavens, what is that? The Professor wants
            some tea! Wake the servants, light the samovar! Lord, what disorder!<br>

            ASTROFF. Will they be here long?<br>

            VOITSKI. A hundred years! The Professor has decided to make his home
            here.<br>
